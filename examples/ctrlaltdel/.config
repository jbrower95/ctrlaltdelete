However, as you try to shut down the operating system, the screen freezes. You press Ctrl-Alt-Del and see 'NOT RESPONDING' next to every application. To escape, you must terminate all the applications, collect the pieces of your friend (who was transformed into a Roman goddess, broken into pieces, and scattered throughout the operating system), and defeat Yung Bill (along with his sidekick, Clippy). Only then will you be free from the corporate machine and return to your pleasant, boring life.",
